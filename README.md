# PythonNewsSummarizer
A python script that summarizes news using NLP algorithms (Extraction Summarize)

# Project Overview
- Fetch News from URL and filter out news contenct (plain text) using beautifulSoup and regex matching
- Generate summary and keyword sets from plain text using NLP algorithms powered by Gensim

# Project Demo 
### [Example News Used](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60780142) (consisting of 981 words)
